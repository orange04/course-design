# Filerobot Image Editor using filerobot service

<a href="https://www.cloudimage.io/en/home"><img src="https://cdn.scaleflex.it/filerobot/filerobot_logo.png" width="200"></a>

Upload the image in your Filerobot storage container, edit it in the Image Editor and upload the result. Deliver lightning fast over CDN.

## Requirements

To use the plugin, you will need a Filerobot token. Don't worry, it only takes seconds to get one by registering
[here](https://www.filerobot.com/en/registration_temp).
Once your token is created, you can configure it as described below. This token allows you to use 25GB of image
cache and 25GB of worldwide CDN traffic per month for free.

## Example

```
<script>
  const config = {
    filerobot: {
      uploadKey: '******',
      container: '******',
      uploadParams: {
        dir: '/'
      }
    }
  };

  const onComplete = function(newUrl, file) {
    console.log('your url for the edited image: ', newUrl);
  };

  const ImageEditor = new FilerobotImageEditor(config, onComplete);

  ImageEditor.open('https://cdn.scaleflex.it/demo/stephen-walker-unsplash.jpg');
</script>
```
